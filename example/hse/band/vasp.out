|      For optimal performance we recommend to set                            |
|        NCORE= 4 - approx SQRT( number of cores)                             |
|      NCORE specifies how many cores store one orbital (NPAR=cpu/NCORE).     |
|      This setting can  greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.     |
|      The default,   NCORE=1            might be grossly inefficient         |
|      on modern multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines.     |
|      Do your own testing !!!!                                               |
|      Unfortunately you need to use the default for GW and RPA calculations. |
|      (for HF NCORE is supported but not extensively tested yet)             |
|                                                                             |

|      Your generating k-point grid is not commensurate to the symmetry       |
|      of the lattice.  This can cause   slow convergence with respect        |
|      to k-points for HF type calculations                                   |
|      suggested SOLUTIONS:                                                   |
|       ) if not already the case, use automatic k-point generation           |
|       ) shift your grid to Gamma (G) (e.g. required for hex or fcc lattice) |
|                                                                             |
